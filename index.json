	"content": "Genesys and Google - Agent Assist and DialogFlow CX Workshop Welcome In this workshop, you will learn all about the Genesys and Google partnership. Specifically, we will focus on how Genesys Cloud CX and Google CCAI can become a dynamic duo! By the end of this workshop, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a DialogFlow CX bot and an Agent Assist Conversation profile integrated in Genesys Cloud CX.\nLearning Objectives  Set up DialogFlow CX integration Build DialogFlow CX bot and use in Architect flows Set up Agent Assist integration with Google CCAI Configure Agent Assist Conversation profile in Google Cloud Platform  Prerequisites  Genesys Cloud org \u0026amp; user with master admin privileges Google Cloud Platform account Installed the Agent Assist integration from AppFoundry Installed the DialogFlow CX integration from AppFoundry  "

	"content": "What is Google CCAI CCAI stands for Contact Center Artificial Intelligence and it has three main components; Virtual Agent, Agent Assist, and Insights. Genesys integrates with Virtual Agent and with Agent Assist. Now that does not mean that Insights is not useful if a business is integrating Virtual Agent and Agent Assist with Genesys. We\u0026rsquo;ll get more into that a little bit more down the page. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s talk a bit more in depth about each of these three components.\nVirtual Agent Google CCAI Virtual Agent comes in two forms: DialogFlow CX (advanced), and DialogFlow ES (standard). Both allow you to build lifelike conversational AI bots using Google\u0026rsquo;s leading AI technology. As you might have inferred from the title of this workshop, we\u0026rsquo;re going to spend the most of our time today on DialogFlow CX. With that being said, let\u0026rsquo;s draw up some of the key differences between DialogFlow CX and DialogFlow ES.\n   DialogFlow CX DialogFlow ES     Advanced Performance Dashboards Performance Dashboards   Intuitive visual builder Form based bot builder   State of the art BERT based NLU models Standard high quality NLU models   Reuse intents and intuitively define transitions and data conditions Flat data model for simple use cases   Easily define and detect minor conversation detours Not supported   Shared intents and training phrases across flows Intents and training phrases not shared across sub-agents   Advanced multi-gurn simulator Standard simulator   Biometric voice identification to identify and verify users Not supported    Agent Assist Google CCAI Agent Assist provides three key capabilities.\n Recommend phrases used by high performing agents to improve the quality and consistency of customer experience Agents can be suggested knowledge base content in regards to a customers issue Transcribes calls in real time for agents to referecne during the call or after for analysis  Insights CCAI Insights is the one component of Google CCAI that does not have a prebuilt integration with Genesys Cloud CX. With that being said, there is nothing stopping a customer from using the Genesys Cloud API\u0026rsquo;s to pass interaction data over to Google CCAI Insights. Insights also is going to be beneficial if a customer is using either the DialogFlow CX or Agent Assist integration because customers can get relevant analtyics data about their Google resources that they built for those integrations.\n"

	"content": "The Genesys and Google Partnership Here at Genesys, we have been growing our relationship with Google for some time. And the joint offerings that we bring together extend much further than the extent of this workshop that we will do today. As a matter of fact, Genesys and Google have a co-innovation agreement. What does that mean exactly? That means that our two companies will work together to create new products that will help businesses transform into people-centric experiences. Our efforts will evolve, but are starting out by looking at these key areas:\n Customer journey orchestration Automated customer care with integrated IoT and customer service Predictive customer satisfaction using Genesys with Google Cloud AI AI-driven multi-factor authentication with geolocation verification Unique conversational channels from Google Search, Google Maps and other Google services  So that\u0026rsquo;s the future. If you\u0026rsquo;re more concerned with what\u0026rsquo;s happening today, we\u0026rsquo;ve got quite a list for you there as well:\n Google TTS integrated into Genesys Architect Google DialogFlow ES (this is the older version of DialogFlow CX) Genesys MultiCloud CX hosted on Google Cloud Platform Genesys MultiCloud CX Private Edition powered by Google Kubernetes Engine  And of course, what we are covering today\u0026hellip;\n Google DialogFlow CX Genesys Agent Assist powered by Google CCAI  "
